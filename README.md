Microservices with Spring Boot – Building Microservices Application Using Spring Boot. Implement a spring boot application with patient’s appointment details [you don’t have to implement a web application for this, you just a database table with all patient appointment details like id, name, email, appointment date and time et
You also need to create required java beans,repo, services, and controllers. You need to test all end points of patient api, a sample json is like below. Also need to create one end point where the patient can send a json doc with http post method[since we are not making any UI here, we are just using postman tool sending POST methods json data to mysql database ]
